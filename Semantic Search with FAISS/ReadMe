The project:
This project implements a semantic search for a python fuctions using a (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
and pre-trained sentense embeddings.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of GitHub issues and comments from the ðŸ¤— Datasets repository.
The dataset is preprocessed to filter out irrelevant data, such as pull requests and issues without comments.

Technologies Used:
-Python
- Hugging Face Datasets
- Transformers
- FAISS
- Sentence-Transformers

Features
- Loads GitHub issues and comments dataset using the Hugging Face Datasets library.
- Filters out pull requests and issues with no comments.
- Processes and preprocesses text data, including concatenation of title, body, and comments.
- Generates embeddings for text data using a pre-trained model from the sentence-transformers library.
- Creates a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
- Performs semantic search to find the most relevant comments for a given query.
