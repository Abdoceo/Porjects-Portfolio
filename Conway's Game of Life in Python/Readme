ðŸ”¹ Introduction
This is a Python implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, a famous cellular automaton. It follows simple rules to simulate the evolution of cells on a grid, creating fascinating patterns over time.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… Object-oriented design with a GameOfLife class
âœ… Supports custom grid sizes
âœ… Allows users to populate the grid with initial live cells
âœ… Simulates multiple steps of the game
âœ… Graphical visualization using matplotlib

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1- Each cell is either alive (1) or dead (0).
2- The next state of the grid follows these rules:
- A live cell survives if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.
- A dead cell comes to life if it has exactly 3 live neighbors.
- Otherwise, the cell dies or stays dead.
