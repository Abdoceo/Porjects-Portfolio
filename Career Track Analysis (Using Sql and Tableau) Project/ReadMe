Key Features:
Row Number Assignment: Assigns a unique identifier to each student-track combination using the ROW_NUMBER() function.

Date Difference Calculation: Calculates the number of days between the enrollment and completion dates using the DATEDIFF() function.

Completion Status: Determines whether a track has been completed using a CASE statement.

Completion Buckets: Categorizes the completion times into predefined buckets (e.g., same day, 1 to 7 days, 8 to 30 days, etc.) for better analysis.
