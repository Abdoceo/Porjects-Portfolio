# Music Genre Classification with PCA and Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict music genres using a dataset containing various musical features extracted from tracks across different styles.
The primary task is to predict the genres of unlabeled tracks by employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then 
using Logistic Regression for classification.

## Objectives
- Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier using PCA-transformed features.
- Compare the performance of the classifier with and without PCA.
- Predict unknown genres in the dataset and fill in the missing genre information.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various musical features extracted from tracks across different genres. 
A significant portion of the records lacks specific genre information, which we aim to predict.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between features to identify highly correlated pairs.
3. **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of the variance.
4. **Evaluating Classification Efficacy**: Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier using PCA-transformed features and compare it with the classifier trained on original features.
5. **Genre Prediction and Integration**: Use the more effective model to predict unknown genres and fill in the missing genre information in the original DataFrame.

## Results
- The PCA-transformed model achieved an accuracy of 0.534.
- The original features model achieved a higher accuracy, indicating better performance without PCA.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression for classification. 
  By comparing the performance of models with and without PCA, we can determine the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in improving model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3 or newer
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, seaborn
