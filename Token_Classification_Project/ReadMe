# Token Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the token classification task, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Datasets library 
for efficient training and evaluation.

Here are the key components of the project:
- Library Installation: The notebook begins by installing the transformers library, which provides state-of-the-art machine learning models 
  for natural language processing tasks.
- Dataset Preparation: It uses the CoNLL-2003 Dataset for token classification, which contains news stories with annotated entities. 
  The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Model Tokenization: A fast tokenizer from the transformers library is used to efficiently process the text data. 
  The notebook demonstrates how to align NER labels with tokenized inputs.
- Model Training: The project fine-tunes a BERT model for token classification, using a data collator to handle padding and a metric computation function
  to evaluate the model’s performance.
  ( The notebook provides a comprehensive guide to preparing the dataset, tokenizing the input data, 
  aligning the labels, training the model, and evaluating its performance on the NER task. 
  It’s a practical example of applying transformers to a real-world NLP problem.)
