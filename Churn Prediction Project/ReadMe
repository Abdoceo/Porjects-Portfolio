Churn Prediction Project:
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset,
which includes various customer attributes such as demographics, services subscribed, and account information.

Project Overview:
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, especially those in the telecommunications industry.
Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave the service) can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers. 

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

This project involves the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- Load the dataset from a given URL.
- Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables.
- Calculate churn rates across different categories.
- Use statistical measures and visualizations to explore relationships between features and churn.

Feature Engineering:
- Convert categorical variables to numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
- Analyze mutual information scores to identify the most relevant features.

Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train a logistic regression model to predict churn.
- Evaluate the model performance on the validation set.

Model Interpretation:
- Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on churn.
- Visualize the model predictions and probabilities.

Final Model Evaluation:
- Retrain the model on the full training set.
- Evaluate the model on the test set to assess its generalization performance.

Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set,
indicating a strong ability to predict customer churn based on the provided features.
Further model improvements could involve using more advanced techniques
such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
